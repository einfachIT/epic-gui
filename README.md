# epic-gui

## Getting started with development on a Raspberry Pi
Most simple solution is to develop on a Raspberry Pi itself. 
1. You can test the app on the environment it is ment to run on. 
2. Needed system libraries are already installed

```bash
https://github.com/einfachIT/epic-gui.git
python epic-gui.py
```

## If you want to run on another deveopment environment, I recoommend to use virtualenv

1. Install virtualenvwrapper and TK System libraries
2. Source source.me
